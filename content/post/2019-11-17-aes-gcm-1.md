An introduction to AES on the JVM - from **ECB** to **AES-GCM**.

#### Unboxing AES
AES is a block cypher that operates on 128 bit blocks of data and supports three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits. AES 
comes with various modes and padding schemes but we start as simple as possible:

{{< highlight kotlin >}}
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE
import javax.crypto.Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec

fun encrypt(payload: ByteArray, key: ByteArray): ByteArray =
    Cipher.getInstance("AES") 
        .apply { init(ENCRYPT_MODE, SecretKeySpec(key, "AES")) }
        .run { doFinal(payload) }

fun decrypt(payload: ByteArray, key: ByteArray): ByteArray =
    Cipher.getInstance("AES")
        .apply { init(DECRYPT_MODE, SecretKeySpec(key, "AES")) }
        .run { doFinal(payload) }

@Test
fun `abc is processed correctly`() {
    val key = "aesEncryptionKey".toByteArray()
    val x = encrypt("abc".toByteArray(), key)    
    decrypt(x, key).also {
        assertEquals("abc", String(it))
     }
}
{{</highlight>}}

First things first, `AES` deals in **bytes**. It makes no difference if the `payload` represents text, images, video or 
any other kind of content, for `AES` they are just bytes. It is the user's responsibility to convert the content to bytes 
when encrypting and bytes back to content when decrypting. The same goes for `key`s. This is the reason for multiple calls 
to `toByteArray` above.  

The encrypted value of `abc` above is: `8C1DB6B1066FD6280452DEE3FC244F94` (see [here](#hex) for a quick reminder 
of what hex representation is). It is 32 characters long and represents a 32/2=16 byte output. Since `abc` is only three 
bytes long, where did the extra 29 bytes came from?

#### Padding - PKCS5

AES, a block cipher, operates on (16 byte long) blocks - nothing else will do. To deal with the situations where the content
size in bytes is not a multiple of 16, the content is padded to the correct size. There are various ways of doing this and
the one used in this case is `PKCS5Padding`. 

You can find the details in [RFC 5652, section: 6.3.  Content-encryption Process](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652) but the important 
part is that the last byte in the last block is the count of bytes that are the padding.

This creates an edge case when the content size in bytes **is** divisible by 16, this is handled by adding an extra block 
that is all padding. Here is a little demonstration:     
 
{{< highlight kotlin >}}
val x = encrypt(ByteArray(0), key)
val y = encrypt(ByteArray(16) { i -> 16 }, key)
 
assertArrayEquals(x + x, y)
{{</highlight>}}

Looking at the actual data we have:</br>
`x=C43037A758F93A86D0BFB8F0862E7B2F` - one encrypted block of 16 padding bytes, each byte has the value 16
`y=C43037A758F93A86D0BFB8F0862E7B2FC43037A758F93A86D0BFB8F0862E7B2F` - first block is the encrypted payload of 16 bytes, 
each with a value of 16. The second block is encrypted block of 16 padding bytes each byte has the value 16

#### Mode - ECB
The instance of AES we obtained by calling `Cipher.getInstance("AES")` has the property that identical blocks of plaintext 
encrypts to identical blocks of cyphertext. This mode of operation is called `ECB`. With `ECB` repeating patterns in 
plaintext translate to repeating patterns in cyphertext, here is a little demonstrations.   

The the `payload` for `encrypt(...)` is the byte array of pixels that comprise the image:

![squares](/img/aes-gcm/squares.png)

and this is the image that uses the encrypted content as pixels to display:

![squares aes](/img/aes-gcm/squares-aes-ecb.png)   

The [ECB Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_(ECB)) is another demonstration
of this effect.



All in all, this hardly

The call `Cipher.getInstance("AES")` gives us an instance of AES in `ECB` mode with `PKCS5PAdding`. 

All block ciphers (given a key) can be considered as a one-to-one function from the set of all possible blocs onto 
itself, a permutation in other words.

#### Hex
A quick reminder on what hex representation is. Each byte (8 bits) is broken down into two nibbles (4 bits each). The range
of numeric values that can be represented with four bits is `0..15` and we use the sixteen characters `0123456789ABCDEF` to
represent these values. For example `hex(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) == 00` and `hex(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) == FF`. Also, since each 
byte is converted to two characters, a byte array of size `n` will be represented by a hex string
of size `2n`
