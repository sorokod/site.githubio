French IBANs are often prefixed with **FR76** 

<!--more-->
some examples:

```
FR76 30056000480048161128019
FR76 30006000011234567890189
FR76 10096183230002533370166
FR76 10907005223602151301111
```


The value **76** represents Check Digits (**CD**) that are used to validate the rest of the IBAN. Intuitively, 
one would expect **CD** to change along with the value of the thing they are checking.  To understand 
this behaviour we will take a closer look at the process of generating IBAN CDs (**ICD**).

### IBAN structure - France

The authoritative description of the structure is available from SWIFT [1]. For our purposes it is 
sufficient to note the following parts of an IBAN: 

|                               |                                      |
| :---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **FR** followed by two digits | The digits are the `ICD`             |
| 10 numeric                    | The bank identifier. `BANK_ID`       |
| 11 alphanumeric               | The account identifier. `ACCOUNT_ID` |
| 2 numeric                     | The French national CDs. `NCD`       |

Example
```
   ICD  BANK_ID     ACCOUNT_ID   NCD  
FR 76   1090700522  36021513011  11
```



### Rules and notation

All whitespace is ignored during processing, it is used in examples for readability only. 

It is possible that generated **ICD** or **NCD** are a single digit, in this case the value is always left-padded with 0 

The  `⊕` symbol indicates string concatenation, for example:

```sh
12 ⊕ 00 = 1200
```

For any integer **x** we define `m(x) = x mod 97`. 



### ICD (IBAN CD) generation

Letters are replaced by digits. This is done by taking A ➔ 10, B ➔ 11, etc... In particular F ➔ 15 and  R➔ 27. For example FR00  ➔  **152700**. 

The value **152700** is actually a constant in **ICD** generation that is defined as:

`ICD = 98 - m(BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID ⊕ NCD ⊕ 152700)` 

 In our example we have

```sh
ICD(   1090700522 36021513011 11) = 
98 - m(1090700522 36021513011 11 152700) =
98 - 22 = 
76
```



### NCD (National CD) generation

While **ICD** generation is common to all countries, the **NCD** generation is specific to France. Other countries use different 
approaches for generating **NCD** or even don't generate them at all as is the case with Germany.  

`NCD = 97 - m(BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID ⊕ 00)`



### Combining ICD and NCD 

Because `BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID` appear in both **ICD** and **NCD**, it is convenient to substitute `X = BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID` . 
Substituting **X** and expanding **NCD**, we can now expand **ICD**:

```sh
ICD = 
  98 - m(BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID ⊕ (97 - m(BANK_ID ⊕ ACCOUNT_ID ⊕ 00)) ⊕ 152700) =  
  98 - m(X                    ⊕ (97 - m(X ⊕ 00))                    ⊕ 152700)
```



we then have:

```sh
m(X    ⊕ (97 - m(X ⊕ 00)) = 
m(100X + (97 - m(100X)) =
m(100X + m(-100X)) = 
m(97) = 
0
```

and finally:

```sh
ICD = 
  98 - m(0 ⊕ 152700) = 
  98 - m(152700) = 
  98 - 22 = 
  76
```



### Conclusions

From what we have seen so far, it may look like `ICD` should always be **76**. To understand why this is sometimes not so, we need to revisit the way `NCD` is generated. Just like with `ICD`, during `NCD` generation, letters are converted to digits, but the way it is done is different from `ICD`:

```sh
   A  J    ➔  1 
   B  K  S ➔  2 
   C  L  T ➔  3 
   D  M  U ➔  4 
   E  N  V ➔  5 
   F  O  W ➔  6 
   G  P  X ➔  7 
   H  Q  Y ➔  8 
   I  R  Z ➔  9

```

This means that if `ACCOUNT_ID` contains  letters, when  `NCD` is generated, the value of `ACCOUNT_ID` it is processing differs from the value of `ACCOUNT_ID` that CID generation is processing.   

Instead of

 `ICD = 98 - m(X ⊕ (97 - m(X ⊕ 00)) ⊕ 152700)`

 we have

 `ICD = 98 - m(X ⊕ (97 - m(Y ⊕ 00)) ⊕ 152700)`  

and terms dont  cancell out nicley as before. 

**The bottom line** is that whenever a French account number is comprised only of digits, the resulting `ICD` is **76**.
